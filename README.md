# Stacker-Game

A simple STACKER Game
The main goal of the game is to stack the cubes to the top without missing any blocks
The game starts with a good speed(default) and it goes faster as you go up the top
The game uses Java Swing components and the game logic is purely invented by the author

## Note
The program was first coded in windows and soon transferred to Mac and these two provide different output when it runs, so users might need to make its own configuration base on their OS
